        A sky view object contains various sky images that are associated with a view of the sky in a single timebin.
        These images can be the flux sky image, at a miminum, and can include other images such as a partial coding
        image, a background standard deviation image, and a SNR image showing the significance of each image pixel.

        This class is very flexible in being able to
            1) construct sky flux images from dpi's, including snr, background standard deviation, and partial coding
                images
            2) load in preconstructed sky flux images with the associated snr, background standard deviation, and
                partial coding images
            2) hold mosaic sky images, including their intermediate images that can easily be summed together

        For this class to hold information related to a sky image, the interm_sky_img, interim_var_img, pcode_img, and
        exposure_img all need to be passed in. In this case, any other parameters passed in will be ignored.

        To contain information related to a canonical flux sky image, including an associated background standard
        deviation sky image, a SNR sky image, and a partial coding image, all other parameters play a role. These allow
        the class to either create a new set of sky images (which collectively we call a sky view) and load in those
        images OR load in pre-calculated sky images that are of the same view of the sky.

        :param skyimg_file: None, or a Path object to the flux sky image file that will either be read in, if it exists,
            or created via batfftimage. If None is specified, a flux sky image file name will be set to be the same as
            the dpi_file (except the suffix will be .img instead of .dpi) and the directory that it will be assumed to
            be contained in will be the same as dpi_file. If the assumed flux sky image exists, it will be reloaded so
            long as recalc=False, otherwise the flux sky image will be created with batfftimage
        :param bat_dpi: None or a BatDPI object that contains the DPI file that will be used to produce a flux sky image in the case
            where skyimg_file is None or the passed in skyimg_file does not exist. The BatDPI must have the dpi_file and
            detector_quality_file attributes defined.
        :param attitude_file: None or a Path object to the attitude file associated with the DPI. If a new flux sky
            is being created, this file is needed.
        :param input_dict: None or dict of key/value pairs that will be passed to batfftimage. If this is set to None,
            the default batfftimage parameter values will be used. If a dictionary is passed in, it will overwrite the
            default values

            recalculated

            flux sky image
        :param create_bkg_stddev_img: bool to denote if the background standard deviation image should be calculated with the
            flux sky image.

            NOTE: for the BatSkyView to recognize that it contains mosaiced images this parameter needs to be supplied
        :param interim_var_img:None or a BatSkyImage object that holds the intermediate mosaic inverse variance sky
            image
            NOTE: for the BatSkyView to recognize that it contains mosaiced images this parameter needs to be supplied
